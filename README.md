# Driving Experience Assistant project
This project was created for young people who are learning driving cars. By using this website, these people will be able to save their driving experiences (driving time, km, driving conditions). And they will also be able to see their total driving kilometers, so they will be able to learn if they are ready to get driving lisence.
